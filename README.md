# PSYQ_YXML_PORT
XML Library for the PSYQ Library

YXML simply needs STDINT.h added to the PSYQ library to work,
just create that file with the needed defines in your psyq/include
folder. You mayalso use the one included in this repo for psyq.

* makefile.psx = PSYQ makefile
* makefile.gcc = GCC makefile, needs a rewrite (original from developer)
